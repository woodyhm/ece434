I have done all of the 6 listed items which include:

	1. installing the latest shipped image on the BeagleBone
	2. setting up a host computer with Linux for kernel development
	3. gathering all the needed SD cards, cables, etc.
	4. installing git on my host
	5. signing up for the two beagle Google groups
	6. writing a simple Etch-a-sketch program

For item 6, I used pygame to create a simple etch-a-sketch program. You use the arrow keys to draw, the spacebar to clear, and the escape key to close the winidow.

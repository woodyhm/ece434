LOGGING IN SHEETS

Sheet ID path: 19pJ-LEOwW_ZRokJ13jbRk7J5Ev7yFSxW7MyowJWMCUY

I used a tempurature sensor (P9_20 and P9_19) and plotted data points in my spreadsheet below.

This is the link to my GoogleSheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19pJ-LEOwW_ZRokJ13jbRk7J5Ev7yFSxW7MyowJWMCUY/edit#gid=0


THING SPEAK

I created a new channel for reading the tempurature on ThingSpeak and put the 
correct API keys in the keys_office.json file, edited and ran my temp.js file,
and successfully completed the homework.

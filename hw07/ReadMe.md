I created the wiki page for our project call "Not Your Average Cup of Joe". I
also set up the GitHub for our project. Below is the link to our repo and
project page.

Repo:           https://github.com/woodyhm/Not_Your_Average_Cup_of_Joe
Project Page:   https://elinux.org/ECE497_Project_Not_Your_Average_Cup_of_Joe

Then, I downloaded the blynk app, created an account, and setup a project.
Below is my the Auth code.

Auth Code: ygP_E6zj87ksieeokqwAY4qMPJ5sS9iK

Then, I installed the blynk libraries on my bone, wired up a button, and ran,
the leds.js file. I blinked the virtual LED using the physical button and then
blinked the physical LED on the bone using a virtual button.

Then, I added a virtual slider into my blynk project and wired up an LED to 
P9_14 on the bone. I added in the required code to leds.js to make the 
slider control the brightness of the LED.
